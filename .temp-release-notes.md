Perfect! Now I have all the information needed. Let me generate the comprehensive release notes:

# Release v0.5.7

## 📋 Overview
This release enhances deployment flexibility with comprehensive environment variable documentation, improves the NPX CLI with .env support, and upgrades the build pipeline with AI-powered semantic release notes generation using Claude.

## ✨ Features
- **AI-Powered Release Notes Generation**: Implements Claude-based semantic analysis of actual code changes to generate professional release notes, replacing basic git log dumps that previously included AI agent commit messages
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Adds comprehensive `.env.example` file documenting all available runtime and build-time variables for flexible deployment scenarios (local, Cloudflare tunnel, self-hosted, etc.)
- **.env Support in NPX CLI**: Adds `dotenv` dependency to NPX CLI to load environment variables from `.env` files in the current working directory, enabling seamless configuration for NPX package users

## 🔧 Improvements
- **Smarter Build Workflow Checks**: Refines the release process to only check for failed workflows when relevant - either when local version mismatches NPM version (indicating incomplete publish) or when there's a very recent failure (< 1 hour old), reducing unnecessary prompts about stale failures
- **Professional Release Notes Format**: Upgrades build script with structured release notes generation including Overview, Features, Improvements, Fixes, Statistics, Deployment, and Migration sections with intelligent fallback to filtered git log if Claude unavailable

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Release Pipeline Reliability**: Fixes false-positive workflow failure warnings by implementing timestamp-based filtering to ignore old workflow failures when versions are in sync

## 📊 Statistics
- **Files Changed:** 8
- **Lines Added:** 280
- **Lines Removed:** 481

## 🚀 Deployment
The new `.env.example` file documents important deployment configuration:
- **HOST**: Server binding address (default: 127.0.0.1, use 0.0.0.0 for external access)
- **BACKEND_PORT**: HTTP server port (default: 8887)
- **PUBLIC_BASE_URL**: Public facing URL for webhooks and callbacks (Cloudflare tunnel or reverse proxy)
- **DISABLE_BROWSER_OPEN**: Skip automatic browser opening on startup (useful for headless servers)
- **RUST_LOG**: Logging level configuration (trace, debug, info, warn, error)

## 📝 Migration Notes
**Breaking Changes:** None

**Recommended Actions:** 
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize as needed for your deployment scenario
- NPX package users should ensure their environment has the necessary configuration options set
