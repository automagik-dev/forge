## Discovery Summary
- **Primary analyst:** GENIE + Human
- **Key observations:**
  - Current upstream submodule at v0.0.95-20250924092007 (detached HEAD)
  - Latest available: v0.0.101-20251001171801 (6 versions behind)
  - 225+ files changed in upstream between versions
  - ~30 frontend files customized for Automagik Forge branding
  - forge-extensions/branch-templates and forge-extensions/genie to be removed
  - forge-extensions/omni and forge-extensions/config are actively used, must keep
  - No production data concerns - pre-release state allows fresh DB start

- **Assumptions (ASM-#):**
  - **ASM-1**: Upstream v0.0.101 is stable and production-ready
  - **ASM-2**: Frontend customizations are primarily cosmetic (branding, naming)
  - **ASM-3**: forge-extensions/omni and config are integrated and functional
  - **ASM-4**: Database schema can start fresh (no migration required)
  - **ASM-5**: Main branch is old direct fork - this branch is the future architecture
  - **ASM-6**: forge-overrides/ will remain empty but kept for future Cargo patches

- **Open questions (Q-#):**
  - **Q-1**: Are there breaking API changes in v0.96-v0.101 that affect our customizations?
  - **Q-2**: Does PendingApprovalEntry.tsx (new in upstream) conflict with our workflow?
  - **Q-3**: Should we adopt all upstream frontend improvements or cherry-pick?
  - **Q-4**: Any runtime dependencies changed (Node, Rust, pnpm versions)?

- **Risks:**
  - **RISK-1**: Manual merge of ~30 frontend files may introduce regressions
  - **RISK-2**: New upstream components may break existing UI assumptions
  - **RISK-3**: Database schema changes may surface at runtime if migrations incomplete
  - **RISK-4**: Omni component integration may conflict with upstream notification changes
  - **RISK-5**: Comprehensive testing required across 225+ changed files

## Executive Summary
Upgrade the upstream vibe-kanban submodule from v0.0.95 to v0.0.101 (6 versions, 225+ files), synchronize ~30 customized frontend files while preserving Automagik Forge branding, and remove dead code (branch-templates, genie extensions). This establishes the foundation for easier future upgrades through the upstream-as-library architecture.

## Current State
- **Upstream submodule:** v0.0.95-20250924092007 (Sept 2025)
  - @upstream/ git submodule tracked in @.gitmodules
  - Backend: Using upstream crates directly via Cargo workspace (@Cargo.toml)
  - Database: Custom `dev_assets/db.sqlite` with v0.95 schema

- **Frontend customizations:** @frontend/
  - ~30 files differ from @upstream/frontend/
  - Branding: forge-dark.svg, forge-clear.png, custom logos
  - Naming: "Automagik Forge" vs "Vibe Kanban" throughout UI
  - Custom component: @frontend/src/components/omni/ (notification system)
  - Partial branch_template removal: @frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/TaskFormDialog.tsx

- **Extensions:** @forge-extensions/
  - **omni/**: Notification system (KEEP - actively used)
  - **config/**: Forge config management (KEEP - actively used)
  - **branch-templates/**: Custom branch naming (DELETE - being removed)
  - **genie/**: Hallucinated feature (DELETE if exists - refers to .genie framework)

- **Overrides:** @forge-overrides/
  - Empty placeholder with .gitkeep (KEEP - for future Cargo patches)

- **Gaps/Pain points:**
  - 6 versions behind upstream (missing features, bug fixes, security patches)
  - branch_template feature half-removed (incomplete cleanup)
  - Dead code (genie extension) cluttering workspace
  - Frontend divergence makes upstream tracking harder
  - Manual merge conflicts every upgrade

## Target State & Guardrails
- **Desired behaviour:**
  - Upstream submodule at v0.0.101-20251001171801
  - Frontend synchronized with upstream while preserving:
    - Automagik Forge branding (logos, colors, naming)
    - Omni notification component integration
    - Custom UI polish and cosmetic improvements
  - Clean workspace: only omni+config extensions remain
  - Fresh database with v0.0.101 schema
  - All smoke tests passing (create project → task → attempt)

- **Non-negotiables:**
  - **Preserve branding:** All "Automagik Forge" naming, logos, theme
  - **Keep omni+config:** These extensions are functional and required
  - **No data loss:** Pre-release state, fresh DB acceptable
  - **Backend unchanged:** Use upstream crates directly (no local overrides)
  - **Testable:** Must be able to run full development cycle
  - **Reversible:** Git allows rollback if critical issues found

## Execution Groups

### Group A – Backend Cleanup & Upstream Upgrade

- **External tracker:** N/A

### Group C – Database & Integration Testing
- **Goal:** Fresh database setup, comprehensive smoke testing, documentation updates
- **Surfaces:**
  - @dev_assets/db.sqlite (DELETE - fresh start)
  - @README.md (UPDATE version references)
  - @DEVELOPER.md (UPDATE if needed)
  - Full application stack

- **Deliverables:**
  - Fresh database with upstream v0.0.101 schema

## Verification Plan

### Validation Commands (Exact Syntax)
```bash
# Phase 1: Backend verification
cargo check --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
pnpm run backend:dev  # Verify starts without errors

# Phase 2: Frontend verification
pnpm run check        # TypeScript compilation
pnpm run lint         # Linting passes
pnpm run dev          # Full stack starts

# Phase 3: Smoke tests (manual)
# 1. Open http://localhost:3000
# 2. Verify "Automagik Forge" branding visible
# 3. Create new project
# 4. Create new task (verify NO branch_template field)
# 5. Start task attempt
# 6. Verify branch name uses default pattern: forge-{title}-{uuid}
```
