# Wish Review – Mobile Native App

**Date:** 2025-11-11Z | **Status in wish:** 📋 PLANNING COMPLETE (WITH ENGAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS)  
**Completion Score:** 82/100 (82%)  
**Review Type:** Wish Completion Readiness Audit (Discovery Phase)

---

## Executive Summary

This review evaluates the **Mobile Native App** wish against the standard wish completion criteria. The wish represents an **exceptionally thorough discovery and planning effort** with 32,000+ lines of comprehensive documentation across 14 files. However, as this is a **planning-phase wish** (not yet implemented), it lacks the implementation artifacts and verification evidence typically required for a full 100-point evaluation.

**Key Strengths:**
- Outstanding discovery work with comprehensive research and technical specifications
- Clear problem statement, solution design, and success criteria
- Detailed 10-week implementation roadmap with phased approach
- Extensive supporting documentation (10 technical specs + 4 research documents)
- Strong alignment with mobile UX best practices from leading AI apps

**Key Gaps:**
- No embedded 100-point evaluation matrix in wish document
- No implementation artifacts (code, tests, builds)
- No validation evidence (QA reports, metrics, screenshots)
- Missing formal approval checkpoints for phase transitions
- Design system universality (mobile + web) needs explicit validation

**Verdict:** GOOD (82%) - Excellent planning foundation, ready for design phase with minor enhancements

## Deductions & Gaps

### Discovery Phase (-2 pts)
1. **-2 pts (Evidence Planning):** Approval checkpoints not formally documented
   - Gap: No explicit approval gates defined for phase transitions (WISH→FORGE→REVIEW→DONE)
   - Impact: Medium - Could lead to unclear handoffs between phases
   - Recommendation: Add formal approval checkpoints in implementation plan

### Implementation Phase (-16 pts expected, 0 actual deduction)
2. **No deduction for missing implementation** - This is a planning-phase wish
   - Status: Planning complete, implementation not yet started
   - This is appropriate and expected for a discovery/planning wish
   - Bonus credit awarded (+9 pts) for exceptional planning documentation

### Critical Gap: Missing 100-Point Evaluation Matrix
3. **Not scored as deduction** - Structural issue, not execution gap
   - Gap: Wish document lacks embedded `<spec_contract>` with 100-point evaluation matrix
   - Impact: High - Makes formal wish completion audit difficult
   - Recommendation: Add evaluation matrix to wish document before implementation phase
   - Note: This review adapted the standard matrix to evaluate planning completeness

### Design System Universality Validation
4. **Recommendation (not a deduction):** Explicit validation of mobile+web universality
   - User note emphasizes: "it should be universal, some people use browser too"
   - User note emphasizes: "ALL THE APPLICATION MUST SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE, SAME COLORS, SAME FONTS"
   - Current status: Design system spec exists but needs explicit validation that:
     - Mobile components work in responsive web browsers (not just native apps)
     - Typography, colors, and design tokens are consistent across ALL contexts
     - CSS breakpoints and mobile theme apply to browser viewports
     - Touch interactions work in mobile browsers
   - Evidence needed: Validation that design system applies universally to:
     - Capacitor native apps (Android/iOS)
     - Mobile web browsers (Chrome, Safari on phones)
     - Desktop web browsers (responsive design)
   - Recommendation: Add explicit section in design system spec validating universal application

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Before Implementation Phase
1. **Add 100-point evaluation matrix to wish document**
   - Embed `<spec_contract>` with Discovery/Implementation/Verification checkpoints
   - Define specific point values for each deliverable
   - Align with standard wish completion audit framework
   
2. **Define formal approval checkpoints**
   - Add approval gates between phases: WISH→FORGE, FORGE→REVIEW, REVIEW→DONE
   - Specify approval criteria for each gate
   - Assign approvers (Product, Design, Engineering leads)
   
3. **Validate design system universality**
   - Add explicit section in design system spec confirming:
     - Same typography across native apps, mobile web, desktop web
     - Same color palette and theme tokens across all contexts
     - Mobile components work in responsive web browsers
     - Touch interactions functional in mobile browsers
   - Create validation checklist for universal design system application

### Priority 2: Design Phase Enhancements
4. **Create Figma mockups with universal design validation**
   - Design for both native apps AND mobile web browsers
   - Validate typography, colors, and visual effects work in all contexts
   - Test responsive breakpoints in browser viewports
   
5. **Prototype gesture interactions for web compatibility**
   - Ensure swipe, long-press, pinch gestures work in mobile browsers
   - Test touch interactions on actual mobile devices (web + native)
   - Document any web vs. native differences

### Priority 3: Implementation Phase Preparation
6. **Set up QA artifact structure**
   - Create `qa/` folder structure for implementation evidence
   - Define artifact naming conventions (test results, screenshots, metrics)
   - Set up automated evidence collection in CI/CD
   
7. **Establish metrics baseline**
   - Capture current mobile UX metrics (load time, bundle size, Lighthouse score)
   - Document current user feedback and pain points
   - Set up analytics tracking for success criteria validation
