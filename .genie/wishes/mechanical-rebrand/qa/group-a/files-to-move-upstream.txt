# Files to MOVE to upstream (not delete) - 3-4 items
# Note: shims.d.ts requires upstream compilation test before moving

# 1. Logo component with theme-aware switching logic
forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/logo.tsx
  → Move to: upstream/frontend/src/components/logo.tsx
  → Reason: Theme-aware dark/light logo switching (lines 9-30)
  → Action: Copy logic to upstream, update paths/alt text during rebrand

# 2. Font variable definitions (partial)
forge-overrides/frontend/src/styles/index.css (lines 8-13 only)
  → Move to: upstream/frontend/src/styles/index.css
  → Content:
    --font-primary: 'Alegreya Sans', sans-serif;
    --font-secondary: 'Manrope', sans-serif;
  → Reason: Custom font variables needed by components
  → Action: Add these variables to upstream CSS

# 3. Companion install task text
forge-overrides/frontend/src/utils/companion-install-task.ts
  → Move to: upstream/frontend/src/utils/companion-install-task.ts
  → Reason: Only branding text changes ("Automagik Omni" → will become generic)
  → Action: Update branding text in upstream during rebrand

# 4. TypeScript module shims ⚠️ REQUIRES INVESTIGATION
forge-overrides/frontend/src/types/shims.d.ts
  → Status: ⏸️ HOLD - Must test upstream first
  → Reason: Upstream uses fancy-ansi and @dnd-kit/utilities
  → Test: cd upstream/frontend && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
  → If upstream has TS errors: MOVE to upstream/frontend/src/types/shims.d.ts
  → If upstream compiles: DELETE from forge-overrides (not needed)
  → Temporary: KEEP in forge-overrides until tested (low risk, 8 lines)
  → See: shims-analysis.md for detailed investigation
